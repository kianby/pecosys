http://playingforchange.com - As we made our way around the world we encountered
love, hate, rich and poor, black and white, and many different religious groups
and ideologies. It became very clear that as a human race we need to transcend
from the darkness to the light and music is our weapon of the future. This song
around the world features musicians who have seen and overcome conflict and
hatred with love and perseverance. We dont need more trouble, what we need is
love. The spirit of Bob Marley always lives on.

This is the fourth Song Around The World video released from the CD/DVD Playing
For Change: Songs Around The World and the follow up to the classics "Stand By
Me," "One Love" and "Don't Worry." This unforgetable track was performed by
musicians around the world adding their part to the song as it traveled the
globe.
